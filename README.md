combine_CSVs.py - pretty self-explanatory. Combines any number of csv files into one, as long as they have the same structure.

csv_to_sql.py - takes a csv file as input and generates a sql script from the data. The resulting script will take the name of the csv file as the table name.
          - usage: python3 csv_to_sql.py <example.csv>
